# Extension Icons

You need to create PNG icon files with the following specifications:

## Required Icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Suggestions:
- Use a timer/clock theme with the "⏰" emoji concept
- Colors: Use blues (#4dabf7) and reds (#e74c3c) to match the extension theme
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Quick Icon Creation:
You can use online tools like:
1. **Canva** - Has icon templates
2. **Figma** - Free design tool
3. **GIMP** - Free image editor
4. **Online Icon Generators** - Search "Chrome extension icon generator"

## Temporary Solution:
For testing purposes, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares in any image editor
2. Use the same image for all sizes (Chrome will resize automatically)
3. Use a screenshot of the ⏰ emoji

## Icon Content Ideas:
- A clock face with "2" prominently displayed
- A timer icon with a red "X" or close symbol
- A simple hourglass design
- The text "2m" in a circular badge

Save all icons as PNG files in this directory before loading the extension.
