## Title
2 mins only — Time limits with a focus plan

## Short description (max ~132 chars)
Set time limits for distracting sites. When time’s up, get redirected to a focus plan page and build better habits.

## Full description
2 mins only helps you stay focused by limiting time on distracting sites and coaching you back to your goals when time is up.

How it works
- Add sites like youtube.com or reddit.com with a time limit (1–120 min)
- A timer starts automatically when you visit those sites
- When time expires, you’re redirected to a simple focus plan page
- The site is placed in a configurable cooldown (default 1 hour)
- During cooldown, visits redirect to the plan page with a countdown

Key features
- Site-specific timers and defaults for popular sites
- Learning mode and smart whitelists for educational content
- Simple popup to view timers and manage sites
- Syncs your settings with Chrome sync storage

Privacy-first
- No account, no external servers, no data collection
- All data stays in your browser (Chrome Storage)

Permissions rationale
- tabs: Detect your current URL and redirect to the focus page
- storage: Save your settings and cooldown state
- activeTab: Access the current tab metadata when needed
- alarms: Schedule timer expirations
- <all_urls>: Ensure timers and redirects work across the sites you configure
